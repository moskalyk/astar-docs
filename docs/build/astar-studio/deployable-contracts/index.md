# Deployable Contracts

Astar Studio simplifies smart contract deployment and management with a suite of user-friendly features. Import, deploy, and add contract collaborators to a smart contract in the contracts dashboard and interact directly with your contract.

## What are my deployment options?

Deployment of contracts with Astar Studio is simplified through a streamlined process directly within our dashboard. Choose from various contract templates (ERC1155, ERC721, ERC20). The Studio also gives you the option to upload your own custom contracts - saved to your project - and can be deployed directly to a network of your choosing.

## What contract interactions can I do?

Astar Studio provides a comprehensive contract dashboard, allowing users to explore and monitor various smart contract activities like transactions, balance, and tokens. Performing read and executing write operations on contracts becomes effortless, making it easy for actions such as minting and collaborations.

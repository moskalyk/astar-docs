# Gas Sponsorship

Sequence wallets - offered via the Astar Studio - are controlled by smart contracts, enabling transaction fees to be abstracted away from users, a concept known in web3 as _gas_. With Astar Studio's Gas Tank, you have a streamlined process for sponsoring gas for your users.

##### Why would I want to sponsor gas for my game?

Obtaining the crypto needed to cover fees poses a challenge for traditional gamers. Sponsoring gas on their behalf solves this problem.

Gas sponsoring in a web3 game provides seamless onboarding by removing gas fees, making transactions efficient and cost-effective for trading virtual assets in various in-game activities. This creates a more enjoyable gaming experience, fostering player loyalty and community engagement.

##### Sponsoring gas with the Gas Tank

Sponsoring gas on contracts is easy, and can be done either by searching and adding a contract or selecting a contract that you have already deployed on a project. Project owners also have control over the contracts they sponsor, allowing them to temporarily disable a sponsor for a specific contract by toggling it off and updating the sponsor settings.
